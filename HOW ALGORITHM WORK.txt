HOW ALGORITHM WORK

1)Handle Data: Open the dataset from CSV and split into test/train datasets.

2)Similarity: Calculate the distance between two data 

3)Neighbors: Locate k most similar data instances.

4)Response: Generate a response from a set of data instances.

5)Accuracy: Summarize the accuracy of predictions.

6)Main: Tie it all together.
